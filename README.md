# resume-modern

A modern resume for the modern person using pandoc and latex.

## Requirements
1. A working LaTeX system
2. Pandoc-- easily installed on macOS with `homebrew` via `brew install pandoc`
3. `latexmk` (probably already installed but see http://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html if not)
3. A plethora of LaTeX packages, all are included in MacTex
4. GNU `make` if you want to use the Makefile included

## Build Resume
Easy as just:
```
$ make
```

... if you're me. Otherwise I think you should edit the document.
